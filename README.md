# Aura

## N322 Final by Summer Sexton

The purpose of this final project is to create a React Native app that is effectively a migraine symptom tracker. Named "Aura" in honor of the type of migraines, this app also uses Firebase to help log information. As a C.R.U.D. app, it allows users to create new migraine entries, update them with any symptoms they may not have previously logged, read past entries, and delete any inaccurate/unwanted ones. This app is created with the intention of helping those with migraines keep a diary of what they are dealing with in a user-friendly manner that takes into account the light sensitivity issues most migraine sufferers deal with.

To run this application, clone the Git repository using the url [https://github.com/snowykittin/aura.git]. Once it has been cloned, run the command `yarn install`. You will want to launch the android or iOS emulator of your choice, then can run the NPM script for your chosen emulator to launch the app.
